# About the Bot

- Uses Tweepy python library
- Reads different tweets at random from replies.txt files and uses it for the posts
- Ignores retweets and only checks for tweets
    + Edit like #13 which defines the query, right now we search for "T-Series" keyword
- Keeps track of all the tweets that it has replied to in replied.txt
    + This is done to avoid replying to the same person's tweet again and again.
